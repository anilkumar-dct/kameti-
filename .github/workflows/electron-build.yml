name: Build/Release Electron App

# === TRIGGER CONFIGURATION ===
# This workflow ONLY runs when a tag starting with "v" is pushed.
# Example: v1.0.0, v2.3.1
# It will never run on a normal branch push.

# === PERMISSIONS ===
# contents: write allows the workflow to:
# - Create or update GitHub releases
# - Upload release assets/artifacts

# === CONCURRENCY CONTROL ===
# If multiple releases are triggered simultaneously,
# older ones will be cancelled to prevent race conditions or duplicate releases.

      # Step 1: Checkout the repository code
      # Required for the CI to access the project files.
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up Node.js
      # Uses Node 20 and enables npm caching for faster subsequent runs.
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4

      # Step 3: Install dependencies
      # npm ci is used for consistent and reproducible installs in CI environments.
      - run: npm ci

      # Step 4: Generate Prisma Client
      # Essential step if using Prisma; otherwise, the build would fail.
      - run: npx prisma generate

      # Step 5: Build and Publish the Electron app
      # Different build commands are executed based on the runner's OS.
      # --publish always ensures artifacts are automatically uploaded to GitHub Releases.
