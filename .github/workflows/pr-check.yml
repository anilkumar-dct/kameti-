    # It will run only if PR target branch is dev or main
    branches:

      - main

jobs:
  validate:
    # Run this job on Ubuntu machine
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Step 1: Download the repository code into the runner
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Install Node.js
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          # Node version used in the project
          node-version: 20
          # Cache npm dependencies to speed up next runs
          cache: npm

      # Step 3: Install dependencies using package-lock.json
      # npm ci is faster and safer for CI than npm install
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      # Step 4: Generate Prisma client
      # Required before build or typecheck
      - name: Generate Prisma Client
        run: npx prisma generate

      # Step 5: Run TypeScript type checking
      # This fails if there are type errors
      - name: Run typecheck
        run: npm run typecheck

      # Step 6: Run ESLint
      # This fails if lint rules are broken
      - name: Run lint
        run: npm run lint

      # Step 7: Run build to ensure project can compile
      # No publishing, only validation
      - name: Run build
        run: npm run build
